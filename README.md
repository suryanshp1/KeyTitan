# KeyTitan Password Generator and Validator

The provided Python code defines a class called `KeyTitan` that serves as a password generator and validator. It generates random passwords that meet certain criteria and validates passwords against specific rules.

## KeyTitan Class

The `KeyTitan` class has the following methods:

### `__init__(self, length=12)`

This is the constructor method for the `KeyTitan` class. It allows you to initialize an instance of the class with an optional password length, with a default length of 12 characters.

### `generate_password(self)`

This method generates a random password based on specified criteria. The criteria for the generated password are as follows:
- The password must be at least 8 characters long.
- It must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
- The remaining characters are randomly chosen from all character sets.
- The order of characters in the password is randomized.

If the password length is less than 8, a `ValueError` is raised. Otherwise, a password is generated and returned.

### `validate_password(self, password)`

This method validates a given password against specific criteria, including:
- The password must be at least 8 characters long.
- It must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

If the password meets these criteria, the method returns `True`. If not, it prints error messages for the specific criteria that the password does not meet and returns `False`.

## Example Usage

The code provides an example of how to use the `KeyTitan` class:
1. An instance of the `KeyTitan` class is created with a specified password length of 10 characters.
2. A random password is generated using the `generate_password` method and printed to the console.
3. The generated password is then validated using the `validate_password` method against the same criteria. If the password is valid, it prints "Password is valid." Otherwise, it prints error messages for the criteria that are not met.

## Summary

The `KeyTitan` class provides a simple and customizable way to generate and validate passwords based on specific criteria. It ensures that generated passwords meet security standards by requiring a minimum length and including a mix of character types. The code can be easily integrated into applications or scripts that require secure password generation and validation.
